Twitter Sentiment Analysis
This project analyzes the sentiment of tweets (positive or negative) using Logistic Regression. The dataset is sourced from Sentiment140 (Kaggle), and the model is trained using TF-IDF vectorization and evaluated with accuracy score.

Features
✅ Preprocesses raw tweets by removing noise and stopwords
✅ Converts text into numerical data using TF-IDF
✅ Trains a Logistic Regression model for sentiment classification
✅ Saves and loads the trained model using Pickle for real-time predictions

Technologies Used
Python – For scripting and data processing

Pandas & NumPy – Data handling

NLTK – Text preprocessing (stopwords, stemming)

TF-IDF Vectorizer – Feature extraction

Scikit-learn – Machine learning (Logistic Regression, accuracy evaluation)

Pickle – Model serialization
